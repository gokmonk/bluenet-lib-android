 *
 * This class is an object to hold and ease conversion of a Bluenet control command message. A
 * control command message is used to read and write to a control command characteristic. A control
 * command message contains the following 3 fields:
 * 		* Type
 * 		* Length
 * 		* Payload
 *
 * And the format is as follows:
 * 		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 		| Type | Reserved | Length (LSB) | Length (MSB) | Payload (Length bytes) .... |
 * 		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 	The reserved byte is used for byte alignment of the length and payload.
 * 	Type defines the type of control command and defines the layout of the payload, see
 * 	  @BluenetConfig for a list of possible types
 * 	Length defines the number of bytes used by the payload
 *
 * 	Note: Byte Order is Little-Endian, i.e. Least Significant Bit comes first
